Repository accompanying the similarly titled manuscript submitted to the journal Behavior Analysis in Practice. 

In this repository you'll find three primary folders. 
1. Alternative Figures: In the manuscript, we included the figures that helped us best describe the most important results we found. However, there are several other methods for taking the derived LDA topic models and visualizing them to see how topics group. This folder stores those visualizations. 
2. Notebooks: In this folder you will find documented showing the steps completed to turn the raw text data into the results presented in the manuscript. One is an .html document for people interested in simply perusing. The second is a .ipynb file that could be downloaded and the code repurposed for those interested in extending the methodology here to novel text data. 
3. Scripts: In this folder you will find functionally the same code as exists in the .ipynb notebook. However, the code here has been refactored into a set of Python scripts that users can download, open in their favorite Python IDE, and feed raw text data into.
