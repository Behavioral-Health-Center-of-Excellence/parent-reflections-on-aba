Repository accompanying the similarly titled manuscript submitted to the journal Behavior Analysis in Practice. 

In this repository you'll find three primary folders. 
1. Alternative Figures: In the manuscript, we presented the figures that helped us best describe the most important results we found. However, there are several other methods for taking the derived LDA topic models and visualizing them for insight. This folder stores those visualizations. 
2. Notebooks: In this folder you will find documented steps for how we turned the raw text into the results presented in the manuscript. One is an .html document for people interested in simply perusing the notebook. The second is a .ipynb file that can be downloaded and the code replicated with similar datasets or extended to novel datasets. 
3. Scripts: In this folder you will find functionally the same code as exists in the .ipynb notebook. However, the code here has been refactored into a set of Python scripts that users can download, open in their favorite Python IDE, and feed raw text data into.
